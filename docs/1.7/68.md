# SQL

SQL queries are specified with the `sqlQuery()` method of the `TableEnvironment`. The method returns the result of the SQL query as a `Table`. A `Table` can be used in [subsequent SQL and Table API queries](common.html#mixing-table-api-and-sql), be [converted into a DataSet or DataStream](common.html#integration-with-datastream-and-dataset-api), or [written to a TableSink](common.html#emit-a-table)). SQL and Table API queries can be seamlessly mixed and are holistically optimized and translated into a single program.

In order to access a table in a SQL query, it must be [registered in the TableEnvironment](common.html#register-tables-in-the-catalog). A table can be registered from a [TableSource](common.html#register-a-tablesource), [Table](common.html#register-a-table), [DataStream, or DataSet](common.html#register-a-datastream-or-dataset-as-table). Alternatively, users can also [register external catalogs in a TableEnvironment](common.html#register-an-external-catalog) to specify the location of the data sources.

For convenience `Table.toString()` automatically registers the table under a unique name in its `TableEnvironment` and returns the name. Hence, `Table` objects can be directly inlined into SQL queries (by string concatenation) as shown in the examples below.

**Note:** Flink’s SQL support is not yet feature complete. Queries that include unsupported SQL features cause a `TableException`. The supported features of SQL on batch and streaming tables are listed in the following sections.

## Specifying a Query

The following examples show how to specify a SQL queries on registered and inlined tables.



```
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
StreamTableEnvironment tableEnv = TableEnvironment.getTableEnvironment(env);

// ingest a DataStream from an external source
DataStream<Tuple3<Long, String, Integer>> ds = env.addSource(...);

// SQL query with an inlined (unregistered) table
Table table = tableEnv.fromDataStream(ds, "user, product, amount");
Table result = tableEnv.sqlQuery(
  "SELECT SUM(amount) FROM " + table + " WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'");

// SQL query with a registered table
// register the DataStream as table "Orders"
tableEnv.registerDataStream("Orders", ds, "user, product, amount");
// run a SQL query on the Table and retrieve the result as a new Table
Table result2 = tableEnv.sqlQuery(
  "SELECT product, amount FROM Orders WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'");

// SQL update with a registered table
// create and register a TableSink
TableSink csvSink = new CsvTableSink("/path/to/file", ...);
String[] fieldNames = {"product", "amount"};
TypeInformation[] fieldTypes = {Types.STRING, Types.INT};
tableEnv.registerTableSink("RubberOrders", fieldNames, fieldTypes, csvSink);
// run a SQL update query on the Table and emit the result to the TableSink
tableEnv.sqlUpdate(
  "INSERT INTO RubberOrders SELECT product, amount FROM Orders WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'");
```





```
val env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment
val tableEnv = TableEnvironment.getTableEnvironment(env)

// read a DataStream from an external source val ds: DataStream[(Long, String, Integer)] = env.addSource(...)

// SQL query with an inlined (unregistered) table val table = ds.toTable(tableEnv, 'user, 'product, 'amount)
val result = tableEnv.sqlQuery(
  s"SELECT SUM(amount) FROM $table WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'")

// SQL query with a registered table
// register the DataStream under the name "Orders" tableEnv.registerDataStream("Orders", ds, 'user, 'product, 'amount)
// run a SQL query on the Table and retrieve the result as a new Table val result2 = tableEnv.sqlQuery(
  "SELECT product, amount FROM Orders WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'")

// SQL update with a registered table
// create and register a TableSink TableSink csvSink = new CsvTableSink("/path/to/file", ...)
val fieldNames: Array[String] = Array("product", "amount")
val fieldTypes: Array[TypeInformation[_]] = Array(Types.STRING, Types.INT)
tableEnv.registerTableSink("RubberOrders", fieldNames, fieldTypes, csvSink)
// run a SQL update query on the Table and emit the result to the TableSink tableEnv.sqlUpdate(
  "INSERT INTO RubberOrders SELECT product, amount FROM Orders WHERE product LIKE '%Rubber%'")
```



## Supported Syntax

Flink parses SQL using [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html), which supports standard ANSI SQL. DDL statements are not supported by Flink.

The following BNF-grammar describes the superset of supported SQL features in batch and streaming queries. The [Operations](#operations) section shows examples for the supported features and indicates which features are only supported for batch or streaming queries.

Flink SQL uses a lexical policy for identifier (table, attribute, function names) similar to Java:

*   The case of identifiers is preserved whether or not they are quoted.
*   After which, identifiers are matched case-sensitively.
*   Unlike Java, back-ticks allow identifiers to contain non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. `"SELECT a AS `my field` FROM t"`).

String literals must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `SELECT 'Hello World'`). Duplicate a single quote for escaping (e.g., `SELECT 'It''s me.'`). Unicode characters are supported in string literals. If explicit unicode code points are required, use the following syntax:

*   Use the backslash (`\`) as escaping character (default): `SELECT U&'\263A'`
*   Use a custom escaping character: `SELECT U&'#263A' UESCAPE '#'`

## Operations

### Scan, Projection, and Filter

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Scan / Select / As**
Batch Streaming | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT * FROM Orders

SELECT a, c AS d FROM Orders
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **Where / Filter**
Batch Streaming | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE b = 'red'

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE a % 2 = 0
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **User-defined Scalar Functions (Scalar UDF)**
Batch Streaming | UDFs must be registered in the TableEnvironment. See the [UDF documentation](udfs.html) for details on how to specify and register scalar UDFs.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT PRETTY_PRINT(user) FROM Orders
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |

### Aggregations

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **GroupBy Aggregation**
Batch Streaming
Result Updating | **Note:** GroupBy on a streaming table produces an updating result. See the [Dynamic Tables Streaming Concepts](streaming/dynamic_tables.html) page for details.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT a, SUM(b) as d
FROM Orders
GROUP BY a
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **GroupBy Window Aggregation**
Batch Streaming | Use a group window to compute a single result row per group. See [Group Windows](#group-windows) section for more details.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT user, SUM(amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY TUMBLE(rowtime, INTERVAL '1' DAY), user
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **Over Window aggregation**
Streaming | **Note:** All aggregates must be defined over the same window, i.e., same partitioning, sorting, and range. Currently, only windows with PRECEDING (UNBOUNDED and bounded) to CURRENT ROW range are supported. Ranges with FOLLOWING are not supported yet. ORDER BY must be specified on a single [time attribute](streaming/time_attributes.html)

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT COUNT(amount) OVER (
  PARTITION BY user
  ORDER BY proctime
  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
FROM Orders

SELECT COUNT(amount) OVER w, SUM(amount) OVER w
FROM Orders 
WINDOW w AS (
  PARTITION BY user
  ORDER BY proctime
  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **Distinct**
Batch Streaming
Result Updating | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT DISTINCT users FROM Orders
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

**Note:** For streaming queries the required state to compute the query result might grow infinitely depending on the number of distinct fields. Please provide a query configuration with valid retention interval to prevent excessive state size. See [Query Configuration](streaming/query_configuration.html) for details. |
| **Grouping sets, Rollup, Cube**
Batch | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((user), (product))
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **Having**
Batch Streaming | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY users
HAVING SUM(amount) &gt; 50
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **User-defined Aggregate Functions (UDAGG)**
Batch Streaming | UDAGGs must be registered in the TableEnvironment. See the [UDF documentation](udfs.html) for details on how to specify and register UDAGGs.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT MyAggregate(amount)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY users
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |

### Joins

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Inner Equi-join**
Batch Streaming | Currently, only equi-joins are supported, i.e., joins that have at least one conjunctive condition with an equality predicate. Arbitrary cross or theta joins are not supported.**Note:** The order of joins is not optimized. Tables are joined in the order in which they are specified in the FROM clause. Make sure to specify tables in an order that does not yield a cross join (Cartesian product) which are not supported and would cause a query to fail.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM Orders INNER JOIN Product ON Orders.productId = Product.id
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

**Note:** For streaming queries the required state to compute the query result might grow infinitely depending on the number of distinct input rows. Please provide a query configuration with valid retention interval to prevent excessive state size. See [Query Configuration](streaming/query_configuration.html) for details. |
| **Outer Equi-join**
Batch Streaming Result Updating | Currently, only equi-joins are supported, i.e., joins that have at least one conjunctive condition with an equality predicate. Arbitrary cross or theta joins are not supported.**Note:** The order of joins is not optimized. Tables are joined in the order in which they are specified in the FROM clause. Make sure to specify tables in an order that does not yield a cross join (Cartesian product) which are not supported and would cause a query to fail.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM Orders LEFT JOIN Product ON Orders.productId = Product.id

SELECT *
FROM Orders RIGHT JOIN Product ON Orders.productId = Product.id

SELECT *
FROM Orders FULL OUTER JOIN Product ON Orders.productId = Product.id
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

**Note:** For streaming queries the required state to compute the query result might grow infinitely depending on the number of distinct input rows. Please provide a query configuration with valid retention interval to prevent excessive state size. See [Query Configuration](streaming/query_configuration.html) for details. |
| **Time-windowed Join**
Batch Streaming | **Note:** Time-windowed joins are a subset of regular joins that can be processed in a streaming fashion.A time-windowed join requires at least one equi-join predicate and a join condition that bounds the time on both sides. Such a condition can be defined by two appropriate range predicates (`&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;`), a `BETWEEN` predicate, or a single equality predicate that compares [time attributes](streaming/time_attributes.html) of the same type (i.e., processing time or event time) of both input tables.For example, the following predicates are valid window join conditions:

*   `ltime = rtime`
*   `ltime &gt;= rtime AND ltime &lt; rtime + INTERVAL '10' MINUTE`
*   `ltime BETWEEN rtime - INTERVAL '10' SECOND AND rtime + INTERVAL '5' SECOND`

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM Orders o, Shipments s
WHERE o.id = s.orderId AND
      o.ordertime BETWEEN s.shiptime - INTERVAL '4' HOUR AND s.shiptime
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

The example above will join all orders with their corresponding shipments if the order was shipped four hours after the order was received. |
| **Expanding arrays into a relation**
Batch Streaming | Unnesting WITH ORDINALITY is not supported yet.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT users, tag
FROM Orders CROSS JOIN UNNEST(tags) AS t (tag)
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **Join with Table Function**
Batch Streaming | Joins a table with the results of a table function. Each row of the left (outer) table is joined with all rows produced by the corresponding call of the table function.User-defined table functions (UDTFs) must be registered before. See the [UDF documentation](udfs.html) for details on how to specify and register UDTFs.**Inner Join**A row of the left (outer) table is dropped, if its table function call returns an empty result.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT users, tag
FROM Orders, LATERAL TABLE(unnest_udtf(tags)) t AS tag
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

**Left Outer Join**If a table function call returns an empty result, the corresponding outer row is preserved and the result padded with null values.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT users, tag
FROM Orders LEFT JOIN LATERAL TABLE(unnest_udtf(tags)) t AS tag ON TRUE
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

**Note:** Currently, only literal `TRUE` is supported as predicate for a left outer join against a lateral table. |
| **Join with Temporal Table**
Streaming | [Temporal tables](streaming/temporal_tables.html) are tables that track changes over time.A [Temporal table function](streaming/temporal_tables.html#temporal-table-functions) provides access to the state of a temporal table at a specific point in time. The syntax to join a table with a temporal table function is the same as in _Join with Table Function_.**Note:** Currently only inner joins with temporal tables are supported.Assuming _Rates_ is a [temporal table function](streaming/temporal_tables.html#temporal-table-functions), the join can be expressed in SQL as follows:

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT
  o_amount, r_rate
FROM
  Orders,
  LATERAL TABLE (Rates(o_proctime))
WHERE
  r_currency = o_currency
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

For more information please check the more detailed [temporal tables concept description](streaming/temporal_tables.html). |

### Set Operations

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Union**
Batch | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM (
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE a % 2 = 0)
  UNION
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE b = 0)
)
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **UnionAll**
Batch Streaming | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM (
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE a % 2 = 0)
  UNION ALL
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE b = 0)
)
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **Intersect / Except**
Batch | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM (
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE a % 2 = 0)
  INTERSECT
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE b = 0)
)
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM (
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE a % 2 = 0)
  EXCEPT
    (SELECT user FROM Orders WHERE b = 0)
)
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **In**
Batch Streaming | Returns true if an expression exists in a given table sub-query. The sub-query table must consist of one column. This column must have the same data type as the expression.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT user, amount
FROM Orders
WHERE product IN (
    SELECT product FROM NewProducts
)
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

**Note:** For streaming queries the operation is rewritten in a join and group operation. The required state to compute the query result might grow infinitely depending on the number of distinct input rows. Please provide a query configuration with valid retention interval to prevent excessive state size. See [Query Configuration](streaming/query_configuration.html) for details. |
| **Exists**
Batch Streaming | Returns true if the sub-query returns at least one row. Only supported if the operation can be rewritten in a join and group operation.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT user, amount
FROM Orders
WHERE product EXISTS (
    SELECT product FROM NewProducts
)
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

**Note:** For streaming queries the operation is rewritten in a join and group operation. The required state to compute the query result might grow infinitely depending on the number of distinct input rows. Please provide a query configuration with valid retention interval to prevent excessive state size. See [Query Configuration](streaming/query_configuration.html) for details. |

### OrderBy & Limit

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Order By**
Batch Streaming | **Note:** The result of streaming queries must be primarily sorted on an ascending [time attribute](streaming/time_attributes.html). Additional sorting attributes are supported.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM Orders
ORDER BY orderTime
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |
| **Limit**
Batch | 

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT *
FROM Orders
LIMIT 3
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |

### Insert

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Insert Into**
Batch Streaming | Output tables must be registered in the TableEnvironment (see [Register a TableSink](common.html#register-a-tablesink)). Moreover, the schema of the registered table must match the schema of the query.

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
INSERT INTO OutputTable
SELECT users, tag
FROM Orders
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

 |

### Group Windows

Group windows are defined in the `GROUP BY` clause of a SQL query. Just like queries with regular `GROUP BY` clauses, queries with a `GROUP BY` clause that includes a group window function compute a single result row per group. The following group windows functions are supported for SQL on batch and streaming tables.

| Group Window Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TUMBLE(time_attr, interval)` | Defines a tumbling time window. A tumbling time window assigns rows to non-overlapping, continuous windows with a fixed duration (`interval`). For example, a tumbling window of 5 minutes groups rows in 5 minutes intervals. Tumbling windows can be defined on event-time (stream + batch) or processing-time (stream). |
| `HOP(time_attr, interval, interval)` | Defines a hopping time window (called sliding window in the Table API). A hopping time window has a fixed duration (second `interval` parameter) and hops by a specified hop interval (first `interval` parameter). If the hop interval is smaller than the window size, hopping windows are overlapping. Thus, rows can be assigned to multiple windows. For example, a hopping window of 15 minutes size and 5 minute hop interval assigns each row to 3 different windows of 15 minute size, which are evaluated in an interval of 5 minutes. Hopping windows can be defined on event-time (stream + batch) or processing-time (stream). |
| `SESSION(time_attr, interval)` | Defines a session time window. Session time windows do not have a fixed duration but their bounds are defined by a time `interval` of inactivity, i.e., a session window is closed if no event appears for a defined gap period. For example a session window with a 30 minute gap starts when a row is observed after 30 minutes inactivity (otherwise the row would be added to an existing window) and is closed if no row is added within 30 minutes. Session windows can work on event-time (stream + batch) or processing-time (stream). |

#### Time Attributes

For SQL queries on streaming tables, the `time_attr` argument of the group window function must refer to a valid time attribute that specifies the processing time or event time of rows. See the [documentation of time attributes](streaming/time_attributes.html) to learn how to define time attributes.

For SQL on batch tables, the `time_attr` argument of the group window function must be an attribute of type `TIMESTAMP`.

#### Selecting Group Window Start and End Timestamps

The start and end timestamps of group windows as well as time attributes can be selected with the following auxiliary functions:

| Auxiliary Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `TUMBLE_START(time_attr, interval)`
`HOP_START(time_attr, interval, interval)`
`SESSION_START(time_attr, interval)`
 | Returns the timestamp of the inclusive lower bound of the corresponding tumbling, hopping, or session window. |
| `TUMBLE_END(time_attr, interval)`
`HOP_END(time_attr, interval, interval)`
`SESSION_END(time_attr, interval)`
 | Returns the timestamp of the _exclusive_ upper bound of the corresponding tumbling, hopping, or session window.**Note:** The exclusive upper bound timestamp _cannot_ be used as a [rowtime attribute](streaming/time_attributes.html) in subsequent time-based operations, such as [time-windowed joins](#joins) and [group window or over window aggregations](#aggregations). |
| `TUMBLE_ROWTIME(time_attr, interval)`
`HOP_ROWTIME(time_attr, interval, interval)`
`SESSION_ROWTIME(time_attr, interval)`
 | Returns the timestamp of the _inclusive_ upper bound of the corresponding tumbling, hopping, or session window.The resulting attribute is a [rowtime attribute](streaming/time_attributes.html) that can be used in subsequent time-based operations such as [time-windowed joins](#joins) and [group window or over window aggregations](#aggregations). |
| `TUMBLE_PROCTIME(time_attr, interval)`
`HOP_PROCTIME(time_attr, interval, interval)`
`SESSION_PROCTIME(time_attr, interval)`
 | Returns a [proctime attribute](streaming/time_attributes.html#processing-time) that can be used in subsequent time-based operations such as [time-windowed joins](#joins) and [group window or over window aggregations](#aggregations). |

_Note:_ Auxiliary functions must be called with exactly same arguments as the group window function in the `GROUP BY` clause.

The following examples show how to specify SQL queries with group windows on streaming tables.



```
StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
StreamTableEnvironment tableEnv = TableEnvironment.getTableEnvironment(env);

// ingest a DataStream from an external source
DataStream<Tuple3<Long, String, Integer>> ds = env.addSource(...);
// register the DataStream as table "Orders"
tableEnv.registerDataStream("Orders", ds, "user, product, amount, proctime.proctime, rowtime.rowtime");

// compute SUM(amount) per day (in event-time)
Table result1 = tableEnv.sqlQuery(
  "SELECT user, " +
  "  TUMBLE_START(rowtime, INTERVAL '1' DAY) as wStart,  " +
  "  SUM(amount) FROM Orders " +
  "GROUP BY TUMBLE(rowtime, INTERVAL '1' DAY), user");

```



### Pattern Recognition

| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **MATCH_RECOGNIZE**
Streaming | Searches for a given pattern in a streaming table according to the `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` [ISO standard](https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c065143_ISO_IEC_TR_19075-5_2016.zip). This makes it possible to express complex event processing (CEP) logic in SQL queries.For a more detailed description, see the dedicated page for [detecting patterns in tables](streaming/match_recognize.html).

&lt;figure class="highlight"&gt;

```
SELECT T.aid, T.bid, T.cid
FROM MyTable
MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
  PARTITION BY userid
  ORDER BY proctime
  MEASURES
    A.id AS aid,
    B.id AS bid,
    C.id AS cid
  PATTERN (A B C)
  DEFINE
    A AS name = 'a',
    B AS name = 'b',
    C AS name = 'c'
) AS T
```

&lt;/figure&gt;

## Data Types

The SQL runtime is built on top of Flink’s DataSet and DataStream APIs. Internally, it also uses Flink’s `TypeInformation` to define data types. Fully supported types are listed in `org.apache.flink.table.api.Types`. The following table summarizes the relation between SQL Types, Table API types, and the resulting Java class.

| Table API | SQL | Java type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Types.STRING` | `VARCHAR` | `java.lang.String` |
| `Types.BOOLEAN` | `BOOLEAN` | `java.lang.Boolean` |
| `Types.BYTE` | `TINYINT` | `java.lang.Byte` |
| `Types.SHORT` | `SMALLINT` | `java.lang.Short` |
| `Types.INT` | `INTEGER, INT` | `java.lang.Integer` |
| `Types.LONG` | `BIGINT` | `java.lang.Long` |
| `Types.FLOAT` | `REAL, FLOAT` | `java.lang.Float` |
| `Types.DOUBLE` | `DOUBLE` | `java.lang.Double` |
| `Types.DECIMAL` | `DECIMAL` | `java.math.BigDecimal` |
| `Types.SQL_DATE` | `DATE` | `java.sql.Date` |
| `Types.SQL_TIME` | `TIME` | `java.sql.Time` |
| `Types.SQL_TIMESTAMP` | `TIMESTAMP(3)` | `java.sql.Timestamp` |
| `Types.INTERVAL_MONTHS` | `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH` | `java.lang.Integer` |
| `Types.INTERVAL_MILLIS` | `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND(3)` | `java.lang.Long` |
| `Types.PRIMITIVE_ARRAY` | `ARRAY` | e.g. `int[]` |
| `Types.OBJECT_ARRAY` | `ARRAY` | e.g. `java.lang.Byte[]` |
| `Types.MAP` | `MAP` | `java.util.HashMap` |
| `Types.MULTISET` | `MULTISET` | e.g. `java.util.HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;` for a multiset of `String` |
| `Types.ROW` | `ROW` | `org.apache.flink.types.Row` |

Generic types and (nested) composite types (e.g., POJOs, tuples, rows, Scala case classes) can be fields of a row as well.

Fields of composite types with arbitrary nesting can be accessed with [value access functions](functions.html#value-access-functions).

Generic types are treated as a black box and can be passed on or processed by [user-defined functions](udfs.html).

## Reserved Keywords

Although not every SQL feature is implemented yet, some string combinations are already reserved as keywords for future use. If you want to use one of the following strings as a field name, make sure to surround them with backticks (e.g. ``value``, ``count``).
