Flink itself neither reuses source code from the “RabbitMQ AMQP Java Client” nor packages binaries from the “RabbitMQ AMQP Java Client”.

# RabbitMQ Connector

This connector provides access to data streams from [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/). To use this connector, add the following dependency to your project:

<figure class="highlight">

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-connector-rabbitmq_2.11</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.1</version>
</dependency>
```

</figure>

Note that the streaming connectors are currently not part of the binary distribution. See linking with them for cluster execution [here](//ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/dev/linking.html).

#### Installing RabbitMQ

Follow the instructions from the [RabbitMQ download page](http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html). After the installation the server automatically starts, and the application connecting to RabbitMQ can be launched.

#### RabbitMQ Source

This connector provides a `RMQSource` class to consume messages from a RabbitMQ queue. This source provides three different levels of guarantees, depending on how it is configured with Flink:

1.  **Exactly-once**: In order to achieve exactly-once guarantees with the RabbitMQ source, the following is required -
    *   _Enable checkpointing_: With checkpointing enabled, messages are only acknowledged (hence, removed from the RabbitMQ queue) when checkpoints are completed.
    *   _Use correlation ids_: Correlation ids are a RabbitMQ application feature. You have to set it in the message properties when injecting messages into RabbitMQ. The correlation id is used by the source to deduplicate any messages that have been reprocessed when restoring from a checkpoint.
    *   _Non-parallel source_: The source must be non-parallel (parallelism set to 1) in order to achieve exactly-once. This limitation is mainly due to RabbitMQ’s approach to dispatching messages from a single queue to multiple consumers.
2.  **At-least-once**: When checkpointing is enabled, but correlation ids are not used or the source is parallel, the source only provides at-least-once guarantees.

3.  **No guarantee**: If checkpointing isn’t enabled, the source does not have any strong delivery guarantees. Under this setting, instead of collaborating with Flink’s checkpointing, messages will be automatically acknowledged once the source receives and processes them.

Below is a code example for setting up an exactly-once RabbitMQ source. Inline comments explain which parts of the configuration can be ignored for more relaxed guarantees.

<figure class="highlight">

```
final StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
// checkpointing is required for exactly-once or at-least-once guarantees
env.enableCheckpointing(...);

final RMQConnectionConfig connectionConfig = new RMQConnectionConfig.Builder()
    .setHost("localhost")
    .setPort(5000)
    ...
    .build();

final DataStream<String> stream = env
    .addSource(new RMQSource<String>(
        connectionConfig,            // config for the RabbitMQ connection
        "queueName",                 // name of the RabbitMQ queue to consume
        true,                        // use correlation ids; can be false if only at-least-once is required
        new SimpleStringSchema()))   // deserialization schema to turn messages into Java objects
    .setParallelism(1);              // non-parallel source is only required for exactly-once
```

</figure>

<figure class="highlight">

```
val env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment
// checkpointing is required for exactly-once or at-least-once guarantees env.enableCheckpointing(...)

val connectionConfig = new RMQConnectionConfig.Builder()
    .setHost("localhost")
    .setPort(5000)
    ...
    .build

val stream = env
    .addSource(new RMQSource[String](
        connectionConfig,            // config for the RabbitMQ connection
        "queueName",                 // name of the RabbitMQ queue to consume
        true,                        // use correlation ids; can be false if only at-least-once is required
        new SimpleStringSchema))     // deserialization schema to turn messages into Java objects
    .setParallelism(1)               // non-parallel source is only required for exactly-once
```

</figure>

#### RabbitMQ Sink

This connector provides a `RMQSink` class for sending messages to a RabbitMQ queue. Below is a code example for setting up a RabbitMQ sink.

<figure class="highlight">

```
final DataStream<String> stream = ...

final RMQConnectionConfig connectionConfig = new RMQConnectionConfig.Builder()
    .setHost("localhost")
    .setPort(5000)
    ...
    .build();

stream.addSink(new RMQSink<String>(
    connectionConfig,            // config for the RabbitMQ connection
    "queueName",                 // name of the RabbitMQ queue to send messages to
    new SimpleStringSchema()));  // serialization schema to turn Java objects to messages
```

</figure>

<figure class="highlight">

```
val stream: DataStream[String] = ...

val connectionConfig = new RMQConnectionConfig.Builder()
    .setHost("localhost")
    .setPort(5000)
    ...
    .build

stream.addSink(new RMQSink[String](
    connectionConfig,         // config for the RabbitMQ connection
    "queueName",              // name of the RabbitMQ queue to send messages to
    new SimpleStringSchema))  // serialization schema to turn Java objects to messages
```

</figure>
